Meson workflow for common view integration tests

Spark and Presto both support common views. These views can be created and manipulated through both the engines.
The tests need to simulate usage scenarios such that a view may be created in one engine, its definition changed in the other engine and the view queried from the
first engine. SQL magics in notebook provide this infrastructure. Further, a notebook can be scheduled to run at a frequent interval to catch any regressions.
This module holds the YAML files needed by Meson. Commuter links in the YAML file are links to the notebook containing cross-engine tests.
